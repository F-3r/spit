#Spit

An html5 spitter utility.

This is mostly a proof of concept inspired in Smalltalk/SeaSide html renderer.

## Motivation

Prove that Ruby sintax is expresive enough to avoid the need of writing web views in pure html or a templating language.


## Usage

As spit is a ruby class with ruby methods, so using it is just as using ruby!

See the (benchmark)[https://github.com/F-3r/spit/blob/master/benchmarks/view.spit.rb] for a possible use case.
