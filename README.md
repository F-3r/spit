#Spit

An html5 spitter utility.

This is mostly a proof of concept inspired in Smalltalk/SeaSide html renderer.

## Motivation

Prove that Ruby sintax is expresive enough to avoid the need of writing web views in pure html or a templating language.



## Usage

As Spit is a ruby class with ruby methods, and the html that is spits is a string, so using it is just as using ruby strings.

Basically, for each HTML tag, there's a method that renders such tag (ex. ```spit.div => <div>```)

See the [benchmark example](https://github.com/F-3r/spit/blob/master/benchmarks/view.spit.rb) for a possible use case.
